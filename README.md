Well detailed Overleaf Latex version of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) Bachelor Thesis for International Undergraduate students who wish to format their final year thesis using overleaf latex template rather than the traditional methods which can be stressful and challenging.

This is the Overleaf Latex version of UESTC Master's Thesis for International postgraduate students who wish to format their postgraduate thesis using overleaf latex template rather than word template which could be stressful and challenging.

# Description
UESTC Thesis Format for International Undergraduate Students has always been in word doc. template which makes it difficult for final year undergraduate international students to meet up with all the necessary formats. To this, I have rewritten the latex format to suit the International undergraduate students.

UESTC Thesis in overleaf latex version for master's International Students. The UESTC Thesis overleaf version available to postgraduate International Students has been repeatedly reported to have some bugs by the students and which makes it difficult for international students to cope with the required format. Issues like wrong page numbering, interference between roman and arabic numbering, inconsistent page header and unnecessary blank pages. In this repository, I have addressed all those bugs, and re-organized the UESTC Thesis overleaf latex version to suit the requirement for master's thesis format.
